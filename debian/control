Description: Installer for drm-free commercial games
 The ./play.it tool builds native packages from installers for Windows or
 Linux, mainly those sold by stores focusing on DRM-free games distribution.
 The goal is that a game installed via ./play.it is indistinguishable from a
 game installed via the official repositories of your favourite distribution.
 .
 The games are installed globally on multi-user systems, avoiding unnecessary
 duplication. The locations of save games, settings, mods, temporary files and
 backups are standardized with XDG Base Directory support.
 .
 Packaging the games simplifies future updates, uninstalls and handling of any
 necessary dependencies, including integrated obsolete dependencies if specific
 versions are needed.
