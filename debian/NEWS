play.it (2.25.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  play.it up to 2.15.1 used to provide game scripts in the same package than
  the core software (its library and "play.it" command). Starting with the
  upstream 2.16.0 release the game scripts have been moved to dedicated
  repositories, and the Debian package is mirroring this change with the
  current update.

  The main change is that installing only this package no longer provides
  support for any game. Game scripts are provided by new dedicated packages:
  - play.it-community, a collection maintained by the same team than the
    ./play.it library and tools.
  - play.it-vv221, a collection maintained by the original author of
    ./play.it.
  Unless you disabled APT::Install-Recommends, these new packages are
  automatically installed as dependencies of the current one.
