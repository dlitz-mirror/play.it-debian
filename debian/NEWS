play.it (2.25.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  play.it up to 2.15.1 used to provide game scripts in the same package than
  the core software (its library and "play.it" command). Starting with the
  upstream 2.16.0 release the game scripts have been moved to dedicated
  repositories, and the Debian package is mirroring this change with the
  current update.

  The main change is that installing only this package no longer provides
  support for any game. Game scripts will be supported by other packages that
  should be included to the Debian repositories at a later date. An alternative
  until these packages are ready is to install the games collections from git,
  here are the ones featuring installation instructions:
  - https://forge.dotslashplay.it/play.it/games — Community-maintained games collection
  - https://forge.dotslashplay.it/vv221/games - vv221ʼs games collection
